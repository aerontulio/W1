        <p>I'm currently enrolled in the BYU Pathway program, working towards a Bachelor's Degree in Software Development. 
            I appreciate the practical learning approach this program offers, and I'm eager to gain valuable insights and skills. 
            I've previously served as a missionary in the Philippines Cagayan De Oro Mission, which has given me a unique perspective on life 
            and a strong sense of purpose as I pursue my academic goals. Outside of my studies, I enjoy 
            listening to music and playing instruments like the guitar, piano, and ukulele. These hobbies serve as a way to unwind 
            and express myself creatively. Overall, I'm focused on a straightforward path of learning and growth, 
            aiming to combine my academic pursuits with my personal interests for a well-rounded experience at BYU Pathway.</p>
